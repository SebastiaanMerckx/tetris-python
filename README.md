# tetris-python
Python program based on arcade library

This game is just created as an experiment with the 'arcade' library.
It can be extended and improved in several ways, e.g.:
* lots of hardcoded numbers in the code
* preview of the next block
* keeping track of highscores
* speed-up based on time instead of on finished lines.

## Controls:
* arrow-left and arrow-right to move
* arrow-up to rotate the block
* arrow-down to move down faster
